# GPCR-Project
The main goal of this project is to predict the 3D structure of a set of class B2 GPCRs.

cutSequence = this code was provided to the team by our TA Owusu Dankwah, we used this script to cut the GPCR sequence so it meets Raptor-X's length limit.

project = this code was written by Luisa, this script developed in python generated an html table with all 20 GPCRs' information.
